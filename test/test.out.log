No information found of A1B1 comparison, CC-GWAS will be based on A1A0 and B1B0. Reading data...

Read data of 10 SNPs for A1A0 from ./test.casecontrol.gwas.SCZ.10snps.txt.gz, of these...
...0 SNPs were deleted based on missing value in at least one column (0%)
...0 SNPs were deleted based on MAF<=0.01
...0 SNPs were deleted with Neff < 2/3 of max(Neff)
...0 duplicate SNPs were deleted 
...maximum OR = 1.09, minimum OR = 0.93
...0 SNPs were deleted based on OR>2 or OR<0.5
...SE is available, z-values based on log(OR)/SE
...transposing ORs to observed scale betas (this may take some time)...
...cor(beta,beta_viaOR) = 0.9998 (SHOULD BE CLOSE TO 1)
...mean(beta/beta_viaOR) = 0.9537 for non-null SNPs with OR<0.99 | OR>1.01 (SHOULD BE CLOSE TO 1)
...resulting in 10 SNPs for A1A0

Read data of 10 SNPs for B1B0 from ./test.casecontrol.gwas.BIP.10snps.txt.gz, of these...
...0 SNPs were deleted based on missing value in at least one column (0%)
...0 SNPs were deleted based on MAF<=0.01
...0 SNPs were deleted with Neff < 2/3 of max(Neff)
...0 duplicate SNPs were deleted 
...maximum OR = 1.08, minimum OR = 0.95
...0 SNPs were deleted based on OR>2 or OR<0.5
...SE is available, z-values based on log(OR)/SE
...transposing ORs to observed scale betas (this may take some time)...
...cor(beta,beta_viaOR) = 1 (SHOULD BE CLOSE TO 1)
...mean(beta/beta_viaOR) = 0.9779 for non-null SNPs with OR<0.99 | OR>1.01 (SHOULD BE CLOSE TO 1)
...resulting in 10 SNPs for B1B0

Merging data based on SNP-names, yielding...
...10 overlapping SNPs across A1A0 & B1B0
...0 SNPs were deleted based on discordant CHR or BP position
...0 SNPs were deleted based on difference in allele names
...alligned reference alleles (changed reference allele in B1B0 to match A1A0 for 0 SNPs)
...Deleted all 0 strand ambiguous SNPs, leaving 10 SNPs for analyses

Of these overlapping SNPs... (this overview can help to double-check input)
...the mean OR in A1A0 equals 1.02496 (should be very close to 1)
...the mean OR in B1B0 equals 1.02297 (should be very close to 1)
...4 are signifacntly associated with A1A0 at p<5e-8
...2 are signifacntly associated with B1B0 at p<5e-8
...the mean allele frequency in A1A0 equals 0.2991
...the mean allele frequency in B1B0 equals 0.30409
...the correlation between the allele frequencies in A1A0 and B1B0 is 0.9964 (should be very close to 1, i.e. > 0.98)

Results may suffer from type I error when the bivariate LDSC intercept would be inflated due to other causes than covariance of error terms
...therefore, take the minumum of the analytically expected and LDSC estimated value
...LDSC estimated value = 0.2425
...Analytically expected = 0.2862 (based on confirmed N_overlap_A0B0 = 24,265)
...Thus, covariance of error terms is modelled based on an intercept of 0.2425

Applying CC-GWAS to identify candidate CC-GWAS SNPs...

Screening candidate CC-GWAS SNPs for potential false-positive association (this may take some time)...
...0 of 1 candidate CC-GWAS SNPs were filtered as potentially due to differential tagging
...0 of 1 remaining candidate CC-GWAS SNPs were filtered by applying a range of disorder prevalences instead of only the most likely disorder prevalence

Of 10 SNPs tested, 1 are significantly associated with case-case status (labelled as 1 in CCGWAS_signif column in outcome).
